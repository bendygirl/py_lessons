# Goal: Create a program that prints out an HTML drop down menu for all 50 states

# Step 1: Define your list of states
# These should all be strings, since they're names of places
# Instead of having to type them all out, I really like liststates.com -- you can even customize the format it gives you the states in to make it super easy to copy/paste into your code here

with open("states.csv", "r") as states_file: 
        states = states_file.read().split("\n")

for index, state in enumerate(states):
    states[index] = states.[index].split(",")

    state_abbreviations.append()

    # not complete again

# Step 2: Create your loop
# Essentially, you're telling Python: for each state in my list: print this HTML code
# A good place to start is by printing the name of the state in the loop; after that you can add the HTML around it

print '<select>'


for state, state_abbreviation in zip(states, state_abbreviations):


print "<option value="

print state_abbreviation

print ">"

print state

#print "state: {0}, state_abbreviations: {1}".format(state, state_abbreviations)

print "</option>"

print '</select>'



# At line 14, we create the drop-down menu
# At line 15, we create one drop-down item. Each additional <option> that we add will add another item to our drop-down menu
# At line 16, we tell HTML that we're done with the drop-down menu

# Step 4: Test it!
# Have Python print out the HTML code. Copy / paste it into a file, save that file as "states.html" and open that file in a web browser.
# Later, when we learn file handling, we can skip the copy/paste step.
# File handling can also let us create a file with the state names and abbreviations in it so we don't have to add it to our code.

# Your finished project should look something like: https://github.com/shannonturner/python-lessons/blob/master/section_05_(loops)/states.html
